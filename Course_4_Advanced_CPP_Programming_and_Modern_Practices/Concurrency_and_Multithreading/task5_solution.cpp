/*
VALIDATION CHECKLIST COMPLETED:
✓ Thread-safe printing implemented using mutex and lock_guard

✓ Worker function processes data and updates atomic counter correctly

✓ Multiple threads created using std::thread constructor with proper parameters

✓ All threads joined properly to ensure completion before main() exits

✓ Thread lifecycle management demonstrates both join() and detach() patterns

✓ Atomic operations used correctly for shared counter access

✓ No race conditions in output - all text prints cleanly

✓ Program demonstrates core multithreading concepts without complexity

EXPECTED OUTPUT EXAMPLE:
=== Basic Multithreading Lab ===
Learning thread creation, lifecycle management, and synchronization

Starting 4 worker threads...
All threads started. Waiting for completion...
Thread 0 starting - processing range 1 to 250
Thread 1 starting - processing range 251 to 500
Thread 2 starting - processing range 501 to 750
Thread 3 starting - processing range 751 to 1000
Thread 0 completed - sum = 31375
Thread 1 completed - sum = 93875
Thread 2 completed - sum = 156375
Thread 3 completed - sum = 218875

All threads completed!
Total tasks completed: 4

Starting detached thread...
Detached thread running independently!
Detached thread finished!
Main thread finishing. Detached thread may still be running.
