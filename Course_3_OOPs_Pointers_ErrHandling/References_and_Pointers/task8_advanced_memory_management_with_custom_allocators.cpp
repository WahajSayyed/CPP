/*✅ Success Checklist
Memory pool pre-allocates blocks efficiently

Custom allocator handles various request sizes

System detects double deallocation and ownership issues

Pool expansion works when needed

Comprehensive leak detection identifies all unreleased memory

💡 Key Points
Dynamic allocation must always include comprehensive error handling and validation

Memory pools can improve performance by reducing allocation overhead

Tracking allocation ownership helps identify responsibility for memory leaks

Setting pointers to nullptr after deletion prevents dangling pointer access

Exception handling protects against allocation failures in resource-constrained environments

❗ Common Mistakes to Avoid
Forgetting to check allocation success before using allocated memory

Not handling bad_alloc exceptions when memory allocation fails

Accessing memory after it has been deallocated (dangling pointers)

Double deletion of the same memory block

Memory leaks from unmatched new/delete pairs

Using delete instead of delete[] for arrays  

🚀 Next Steps
These advanced memory management techniques are essential for developing high-performance applications in industries like gaming, financial services, and embedded systems. Understanding custom allocators and memory pools prepares you for roles in systems programming, performance engineering, and developing memory-critical applications where efficient resource utilization is paramount for success.*/
